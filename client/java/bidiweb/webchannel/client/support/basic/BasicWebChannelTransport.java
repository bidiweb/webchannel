/**
 * WebChannel Transport for creating native thread-safe Java WebChannels.
 *
 * <p>WebChannels created by the same transport instance use two shared executors. One single
 * threaded {@code apiThreadExecutor} for asynchronous API calls, handler, and internal callback
 * calls. The other unbounded cached {@code networkExecutor} for handling blocking network traffic.
 * As a result, clients are likely to get <i>O(n)</i> threads for <i>n</i> active channels. The
 * inactive threads are evicted when unused for some time. You can explicitly force freeing any
 * resources (i.e., all the threads from the executors) by calling the shutdown method. Note however
 * that any active channels created by the shut down Transport would be broken.
 *
 * <p>To ensure isolation of WebChannels, you can use one transport per channel or group of channels
 * that need to be isolated.
 *
 * <p>Use the following code to open a thread-safe {@link AsyncWebChannel} instance:
 *
 * <pre>
 * WebChannelTransport transport = WebChannelTransport.createBasicWebChannelTransport();
 * AsyncWebChannel channel =
 *     transport.createAsyncWebChannel(
 *         "http://myservice.example.com/channel", new WebChannelOptions.Builder().build());
 * channel.setChannelHandler(myHandler);
 * channel.open();
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>Note that the resulting AsyncWebChannel enforces method call sequencing, i.e., the channel
 * handler can only be set before the channel open() call and the open() call must be made before
 * send() and close() calls. Violation results in a runtime exception.
 *
 * <p>The getRuntimeProperties() method is not implemented as the underlying channel implementation
 * is not thread safe. Calling it will result in a runtime exception.
 *
 * <p>Only Asynchronous WebChannels are supported by this transport.
