#v9 protocol (draft)

##Handshake and WebChannel Messages
1. Handshake response should indicate the content-type of "control" messages and "data" messages. And the handshake response is a JSON message.
2. For v9, all control messages will be JSON (application/json) formatted.
   Data messages may be binary (protobuf) or JSON (JSPB).
   * a candidate format for control messages is "application/cbor" (rfc7049)
      which offers direct JSON mapping while optimized for efficiency on the client-side.
   * CBOR has a pure Java (JDK) implementation, portable for iOS.
3. For a given session (HTTP request/response), all data messages will be
   proceeded by a control message that should contain all the necessary metadata
   about the data messages that follow the control message.
4. In the event of an abort, some data messages may be lost, which is expected.

To minimize the production risk, no change to the existing v8 protocol beyond the above framing-level changes.

Some WS opcodes may not be used by v9, and in v10 we will optimize the signaling signficantly.
