Protocol and runtime expectation for a v8 compliant server implementation (04/2017)

Send-Queue behavior
* message id monotonically increasing (int32)
* bounded by # of messages and byte sizes
* support requeue (retransmit)
* support urgent-messages as a separate queue

Client message behavior
* urgent: real-time delivery at the cost of efficiency
* unreliable: OK to drop
* message id
* retransmitting (in the queue)
* timestamped progress state: 
  * sent, unsent, retrying, delivered (acked)
  * discarding (unreliable), dropped (never to deliver)
* format: [id, [...]]  
  
Protocol state
* last message (array) id
* last message (array) id that has been acked
* last client request id (RID)
* last client message id (map): duplicates possible; gaps allowed (if client decides to drop v.s. retry)
* GET req: RID=rpc
* POST req: TYPE=terminate (client abort) -- duplicate OK
* initial POST: last request id = RID - 1; return ["c", "session-id", "", version, cversion]
* POST req: AID (acked server message id)
* POST resp: [back_channel_exists, last-server-sent-message-id, unacked-outstanding-bytes]
* POST resp: [number chars]\n[array data]
* POST req format (form encoded):  [count] [ofs] [req#_name: value] ...
* POST req format:  {type: "_badmap"}  for messages that can't be serialized on the client side
* GET req: CI (close immediately); t (retry count);
* GET req: AID (acked server message id)
* GET resp: first noop (if nothing queued)
* GET resp format: JSON arrays, length prefixed + "\n"
* Client may append new messages to a retry POST
* Req: SID (session id, if not the first POST)
* First POST: OSID, OAID (for tracking/stats of dropped messages, if reconnecting)
* GET req: TYPE=xmlhttp ...

HTTP detail
* Default C-T:  "text/plain; charset=utf-8"    Safari: "text/chat; charset=utf-8" (buffering up to 1KB)
* Firefox/IE: GET resp compression disabled  ...
* Disable cache
* "X-Frame-Options": "ALLOWALL" (iframe handling)
* Handshake failure: BAD_REQUEST, "Unknown SID"
* Blocked host name: ...
* Initial text block for IE: ...

Channel test
* Disable compression
* Req param: MODE=init
* Init resp: [...] (ignored)
* test req behavior:  "11111" (safari buffering); add 1s delay; "2"
* echo X-Client-Wire-Protocol, (may not working due to forward proxies)

Config params
* max. pending messsages: 10,000
* max. pending bytes: 100MB
* max client requests: 2 or 10, 100
* max. bytes per a single GET: 100KB
* max. bytes per flush (back channel): 50KB  -- useless
* max. # of messages per POST: 1000
* max. # of unacked messages to hold: 200 
* default backchannel inactivity timeout: 60s
* default keep-alive message (noop) interval: 30s
* max. buffered GET open: same as keep-alive, 30s (both are meant to keep connections from being prematurely closed by network)
* wait time before delivering non-urgent data over buffered connections: 15s
* interval to keep (unbuffered) GET open: 45s (60s effectively, only checked with data to send, e.g. noop)
* default delay for channel test: 1000ms
* Clean up (stale connection with no I/O activity) interval: 15 min.  Stale (no activity) after 5 min.

Channel state
* Init
* Open
* Closed

Buffered mode
* Buffered
* UnBuffered
* Disconnected

Close reason
* Terminated
* Error
* Inactive timeout
* Stale    ??
* Unknown
* Channel not allowed (by application hook)

Commands
* "c" - send connection data
* "noop"
* "stop" - close the channel (abort)

Useful monitoring stats
* missing backchannel, when serving a post
* backchannel data quote
* backchannel reconnect ratio (flaky network)
* backchannel drop and recovery count (I/O error, ISP)
* buffered channels
* interval without backchannel
* rate and interval with max. bytes reached 

Misc.
* randomize a value with maximum - nextInt(maximum / 5)
* API for recording dropped messages when abort
